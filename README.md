# News Spam Classifier

##  What is News Spam Classifier ?

The News Spam Classifier is a machine learning-based application designed to identify whether a piece of news text is spam or not spam (ham). It aims to help users automatically filter irrelevant, misleading, or spammy news articles 


## Live Interface with Streamlit

This project includes a simple experiment using Streamlit to build a web interface.It allows users to interactively input news content and receive a classification result (spam or not spam) directly in the browser.

This is my first attempt at learning and experimenting with Streamlit, aiming to understand how to deploy machine learning models

To run the app locally: 
```
streamlit run Stream-app.py
```
